In the article for an international publication, he argued that the Nehru-Gandhi family has \"cemented the idea that political leadership can be a birthright\" and that it is \"high time India traded dynasty for meritocracy\". Tharoor noted that this trend is not limited to one party but has penetrated politics across every party and region. The comments have been seized upon by the BJP, while the Congress party has remained largely silent on the matter."
